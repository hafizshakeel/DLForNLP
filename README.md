# DLForNLP

In this repository, I will share my insights and implementations related to deep learning in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Table Of Contents
- [NLP BASICS](#nlp-basics)
- [ADVANCED NLP MODELS](#advanced-nlp-models)

## NLP BASICS
This folder contains implementations of fundamental NLP models using PyTorch:
1. **Word2Vec**: Basic implementation for word embeddings.
2. **RNN Basics**: Simple implementations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
3. **Image Captioning**: Model to generate captions for images using sequence models.

## ADVANCED NLP MODELS
This folder includes implementations of more advanced NLP models:
1. **Seq2Seq Machine Translation (Without Attention)**: Basic sequence-to-sequence model for machine translation.
2. **Seq2Seq Machine Translation (With Attention)**: Enhanced sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism.
3. **Transformers from Scratch**: Implementation of transformer networks for NLP tasks.
4. **Seq2Seq Machine Translation Using Transformer**: Advanced sequence-to-sequence model using transformers for machine translation.
