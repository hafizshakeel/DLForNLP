# DLForNLP

In this repository, I will share my insights and implementations related to deep learning in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Table Of Contents
- [NLP BASICS](#nlp-basics)
- [NLP ADVANCED](#nlp-advanced)

## NLP BASICS
This folder contains implementations of fundamental NLP models using PyTorch:
1. **Word2Vec**: Basic implementation for word embeddings using Skip Gram and CBOW models.
2. **RNN Basics**: Simple implementations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including GRU, LSTM, and BiLSTM.

<br>

## NLP ADVANCED
This folder includes implementations of intermediate to advanced NLP models:
1. **Image Captioning**: Model to generate captions for images using a sequence model (pre-trained Inception_v3 as encoder and LSTM as decoder).
2. **Seq2Seq Machine Translation (Without Attention)**: Basic sequence-to-sequence model for machine translation.
3. **Seq2Seq Machine Translation (With Attention)**: Enhanced sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism for machine translation.
4. **Transformers from Scratch**: Implementation of transformer networks for NLP tasks.
5. **Seq2Seq Machine Translation Using Transformer**: Advanced sequence-to-sequence model using transformers for machine translation.
6. **Vision Language Models**: Coming soon.
